____

### What is a game
- an objective engine
- a set of rules and objectives
- an interactive experience that provides the player with an increasingly challenging sequence of patterns which she or he learns and eventually masters
- Most two and three dimensional games are examples of soft real-time interactive agent-based computer simulations

#### Simulation
- Most video games take a small subset of a real or imaginary world and attempt to model it mathmematically
- All models are an approximation - impreactical and generally not fun to simulate every last detail
- Creative liberties can be taken with reality to enhance the player's experience.

#### Agent-based
- What is an Agent
 - Entities such as vehicles, weather.....
 
#### Interactive remporal simulation 
- Interactive Video games are examples of temporal situation
- the world is dynamic

#### Real-Time simulation
Real-time systems must process information and respond within a specific period of time


### What is Unity
> Suite of different technologies and tools whose purpose is to help developers create interactive software products, most notably games.
- Products made in Unity can be distributed to multiple platforms

### What is a successful game?
1. Engaging
2. Entertaining
3. Enjoyable
4. Elastic 
5. Expandable
6. Expose users to other players (social)


#### Audience
- You are not building the game for you
- Think about your audience
- Small things matter
 - can I adjust controls
 - can I change/modify the character
 - does it come in blue

### Game Loop
1. gather player input
2. update world status
3. apply game logic
4. draw frame
5. back to 1


### Game Time
- independent of real-rime, though usually coincides with it
- we can pause reverse or slow down our game-time
- rendering and some other systems can operate on an independent timeline and continue to function in real-time
