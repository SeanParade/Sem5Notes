### Lighting
#### Reflection & Shadows
- reflected path changes with the angle of the camera
- If Reflection Probes are used they become the Reflection Source and Intensity for the objects under their influence, so global reflection settings don't have an efect on the objects
- Reflection Bounces define how many times the reflection can bounce among several probes
##### Standard lights
- All standard realtime lights apply direct lighting and shadoes on the objs
- first Directional Light in the scene is considered as _Sun_ by default. Defaul Skybox gets its intensity and color adjusted depending on the Sun's horizontal inclination
- Precomputed realtime lighting throws in light bounces, color bleeding and emissive materials in real time.
- Everything can change dynamically, (light color intensity material color, material, emission) and the lighting gets updated in real time.
##### Emissive Materials
- objs flagged as static contaning an emissive material emit light according to their geometry
##### Baked Lightmaps
- ambient light, stdrd lights (baked or mixed), light bounces and emissive materials are baked into lightmap textures.

##### point lights
- point light is located at a point in space and sends light out in all directions equally
- direction of light hitting suface is the line from the point of contact back to the center of the light object
- intensity dimishes with distance from the light, reaching zero at a specified range. Light intensity si inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source
- *inversive square law* close to how it works in the real world
##### Spot light
- like point light, spot light has a specified location and rang over which the light falls off.
- spot light is constrained to an angle, resulting in cone shape area of illumination
##### Directional lights
- very useful for creating effects such as sunlight
- behaving like the sun, directional lights can be thought of as distant light sources which exist infinitely far away
- does not have identifiable source position so it can be placed anywhere in the scene
- the light does not diminish
