___

### 3d Environment and Lighting
- Level Building & lighting
#### Camera
- View Frustrum is the "view cone"
- near clipping plane
 - scene view beginning
- far clipping plane
  - scene view ending
#### 3D Coordinate system
- x (+left, -right)
- y (+up, -down)
- z (-in, +out) 
#### Skybox
- Wraps around the entire scene
- gives impression of vast environment beyond scene
- box made up of 6 textures for each box face
#### Modular Environments
- Building finished level 'modules' or 'components'
  - e.g. generic room walls, corridors, stairs
- assembling those modules into a complete level
- reuseability of modules accross levels (and games)
  - don't add level specific scripts to your prefabs
- Allows level designers to tweak a level inside unity, without having to reimport the entire level
#### Lighting
- Dynamic lighting
  - changing light
  - Light source of all scene objects computed each frame
  - types: point light, spotlight, directional light
  - can change it properties on the fly
- Static Lighting
  - create light maps for light sources that are fixed
  - Only static object can have light map applied
  - computes scene via dynamic light sources and bakes the result onto a light map shared by all static objects
  - removing static object will not remove its shadow without recalculating the light map
  - static obj mesh must have light map UVs
  - Primitive shapes have UVs
  - Mode controls baking and runtime lighting behavior
#### Terrain Editting
- Inspector controls
  - Raise/lower
  - Flatten
  - Paint
  - Place Trees
  - Paint Detail Objects (blades of grass, rocks, etc)
