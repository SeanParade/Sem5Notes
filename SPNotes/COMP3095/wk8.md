# JSP

### Concept
- use regular markup for most of the page
- mark servlet code with special tags
- servlet code is run on the server and sent in the response
### Benefits
- Read/Write html within jsp
- Specialization 
  -  Split up work between presentation layer and application layer
- Organized code
  - Seperate java code that creates the content from the presentation layer

### Life Cycle
- Look up flow chart
  
### ON TEST
> JSPs are servlets. Jsps are java code being run through a "translator" (probably meant compiler).
