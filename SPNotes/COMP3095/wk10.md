- Beans are classes that follow certain rules
  - 0 arg constructor
  - should have no public instance variables
    - using access methods (getters, setters)
  - Persistent values should be accessed the methods name getXxx and setXxx
    - booleans may use isXxx instead of getXxx
- can be accessed with `${instance.property}`
- if logic needs to be done to a property it can be done in the accessor or mutator methods
#### jsp:useBean
- `<jsp:useBean id="beanName" class="package.Classname">` to bring in a bean to a jsp page.
- this instantiates the beans 0 arg constructor
- you can directly call a jsp from a form `<FORM ACTION="SomePage.jsp">`
- differs from a `<@% page import="` in its visibility/scope
- *Scope* can be set in useBean
  - `<jsp:useBean id="foo" class="..." scope="application"/>`
- Scope types;
 - page (default)
   - bean object placed in the page context for duation of the request only
   - lets methods in the same servlet access a bean
 - request
   - bean object placed in ServletRequest object for the duartion of the current request
   - available by `getAttribute`
 - session
   - Bean stored in HttpSession object associated with the current request
   - accessed from regular servlet code with `getAttribute` and `setAttribute`
 - application
   - Bean stored in ServletContext (available through the application variable or `getServletContext()`
   - ServletContext is shared by all servlets in the same web application
