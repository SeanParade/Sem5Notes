### Location services
- needs an api key stored in the manifest
  - store it as a string resouce and then refer to it
- Start a google maps project in android studio
- maps should be added as fragments (optional)
- needs a Location Manager object
- You can either find a location or set your location
  - LatLng is a commonly used location class
- Geocoder constructor is passed `this` which is a location tied to the current context - (link)[https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Geocoder.html]
- maps have a camera object that can be controlled.

### Unit Test
#### Usual way
1. Design a class
  - satify user requirements (make it do what it is supposed to do)
2. Test the code with expected inputs
#### Unit testing way
1. Design a class
2. Programatically test it and record the tests.
3. (optional) Make the entry point to your application a series of tests
- When you create a class, you also create a test class for it.
  - most IDEs for OOP langs can create test classes that same way you create a normal class
- `setUp()` is for intancing objects that are needed in order to test methods
- `test()` is obv for your tests
- No control over the order of how the tests are run
- Build systems run tests automatically
``` java
@Before // annotation for before tests
public void setup(){
  myCounter = new Counter();
}

//passes
@Test  // annotation for tests to do
public void test1(){
  myCounter.increment();
  assertEquals(1, myCounter.getCtr())
}

//fails
@Test
public void test2(){
  myCounter.increment(); //i=1
  myCounter.increment(); //i=2
  assertEquals(1, myCounter.getCtr() //i=1 == false
}

@After // annotation for after tests
public void tearDown(){
  myCounter = null;
}

```
- Tests have no relationship to normal classes
- You can use mock objects for things that haven't been completed but are necessary for testing a class

```java
// in setup
stockService = mock(StockService.class);

// in test
when(stockService.getPrice(googleStock)).thenReturn(50.00);

//then when getPrice is called in another class, it will return 50.00

```

- JUnit must be added to the build path in order to test
