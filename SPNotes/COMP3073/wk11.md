### XML Images and Drawables
#### Drawing app
- Usually a good idea to use some kind of toolbar (some kind of small space on the screen that has quick access to common tools)
- Use iconography that a user would be familiar with
- consistency is important in UX (e.g. keep tool selection in one place)
- When app is paused, it should remove listeners for sensors and onResume should re-enable them.
- `<item>` is used for menu items
  - contains id, title, icon, and showAsAction (ifRoom shows the item if there is room in the view; if not, it is put into the overflow items)
- Screen size is important to good UI design
- saving images
```java
if (shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale(Minfest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)){
...
}

public onRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode, String[] permissions, int[] grantResults){
	swith (requestCode){
		case SAVE_IMAGE_REQUEST_PERMISSION_CODE:
		...
	}
}

```
- keep coupling of fragments/activities loose
- bitmap: drawing area for displaying or saving
- bitmapCanvas: used to draw on the bitmap
- paintScreen: used to draw the bitmap onto screen
- paintLine: used to draw lines on to the bitmap
- ` private final Map<Integer, Path> pathMap = new HashMap();`
- ` private final Map<Integer, Point> previousPoint = new HashMap();`
``` java
// changing image on rotation

@Override 
public void onSizeChanged(int w, int h, int oldW, int oldH){
	bitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(getWidth(),getHeight());
	...
}
```
#### Drawable xml

```xml
<item >
  <shape android:shape="rectangle">
    <corners android:radius="3dp" />
	<stroke android:width="1dp" android:color="#ff8000" />
	<gradient android:angle="-90" android:color="#000000" />
  </shape>
</item>
```
