### What is a game
- an objective engine
- a set of rules and objectives
- an interactive experience that provides the player with an increasingly challenging sequence of patterns which she or he learns and eventually masters

#### Simulation

- All models are an approximation - impreactical and generally not fun to simulate every last detail
- Creative liberties can be taken with reality to enhance the player's experience.

#### Agent-based
- What is an Agent
 - Entities such as vehicles, weather.....
 
#### Interactive remporal simulation 
- Interactive Video games are examples of temporal situation
