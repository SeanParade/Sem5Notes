Lecture 2
Servlet Intro and Basics

1. Web Application Structure and Directories
2. Code and test simple servlets
3. Use web.xml file or annotation to map a servlet to a URL

Servlet Job:
- read explicit data sent by client
- read implicit data
- gen results
- send explicit data back to the client (HTML)
- send implicit data back (status codes/response headers)

Servlet Example (Generate Plain Text):
- a java class file
- extends HTTPServlet
- @WebServlet annotation
	- do not forget to do this *
	- previously servlets configured in web.xml file
	- annotation ensures TomCat interprets this as a servlet

We've seen notations before: ex. @Override
	- overrides a parent method
