Tyler (dude who helps with Capstone stuff)
- Adopting best practice principles
- Intro the projects working with
- Build collaboration b/w programmers + post-graduate business analysts
- Agile Development

Agile Development:
- iterative, incremental
- collaborative
- cost-effective, timely

4 key principles:
1. individuals and interactions > processes and tools
	- work with people to work out what's needed
2. working software > comprehensive documentation
	- sometimes documentation is mandatory (big, governed orgs)
3. customer collaboration > contract negotiation
	- working with people = foundational to incrementally deliver over "sprints"
4. responding to change > following a plan
	- gives opportunity to deviate from rigid plans
	- ie. waterfall = once you define what you're building, you need to build exactly that
		- by the time of release, the original specs = no longer the need
	- respond to needs in "real-time"

Backlog:
Prioritize Low priority -> High Priority
"User stories" AKA requirements
- build the backlog
- what the project needs

Daily meetings (10-15 minutes)
- what has been delivered
- what has been done 
- what needs to be done

Showcase:
Present to our partners what has been completed successfully
- demo of functionality that has been implemented

After: Sprint again
- which next user stories are you going to work on?

Evolution of Requirements:
- Idea & Feasibility
	- Vision
	- Aspirational Journey
- Scope Definition
	- User Story & Process Maps
	- Low-Fidelity Wireframes
- Execution/ Build/ Test
	- Use-Case & Mockups

Tyler will possibly come before class (we'll start early on those days)


<hr>

Regular class notes start here

Project Initiation:
1. Developing a Charter
2. Developing a Preliminary Scope Statement

5 Steps to Defining a Project:
1. define charter
2. define prelim. scope statement
3. define stakeholders
	- what is their role/involvement with the project?
4. create RAM
	- Responsibility Assignment Matrix
	- primary responsible member, secondary, etc.
5. obtain sign-off

Determining the "Real" Need
- driver/ main purpose (why do we need this?)
- research circumstances that lead to the driver
- SWOT analysis - Strength Weakness Opportunities and Threats

From now->
- take minutes at group meetings

For us:
Priorities:
1. Scheduling/ Calendar
	- inputing orders?
	- take due date and schedule accordingly
	- things to keep in mind: 
		- juggling available equipment?
			- equipment will be ---	
		- what happens when a new order conflicts with timing of another?	
		- what happens when a process is started/ running late?
2. Inventory management?
3. Recipe Steps Walkthrough (Tap-through)
	- extending to mobile app?
	- would be cool to add the other functions to mobile as well

other questions:
- what users would be authorized to add inventory/ start scheduling?

What we need to do this week:
- make a list of information we need, and send to Jan

what I need to do this week:
- learn JSNode
- specifically look up how to connect to database using JSNode
