questions for business requirements and other general capstone notes

- equipment 
	- switch over time?
	- cleaning time?
	- does the equipment ever have malfunctions that set back the timing?
		- (do we need to have a plan in place in case of malfunctions,
			being able to pause or change scheduling of baking)
- users
	- what will regular users be able to access? 
		- the schedule for themselves only?
		- the schedule for the whole bakery?
		- the inventory and back end? (or just elevated users ie. manager and owners)

- possible use cases to plan for?
	- e.g. scheduled baker not coming in, reassigning duties to someone else
	- e.g. equipment breakdown or malfunction, unexpected situations that might delay the
		continuation of recipes / scheduling
