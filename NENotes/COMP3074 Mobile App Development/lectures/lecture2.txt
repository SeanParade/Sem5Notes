Android Applications
1. Activities
2. Services (started?? and bound?)
 - what are services?
 	- bound services:
		eg. GPS app, depends on GPS
	- started? services:
		eg. keeping track of stock prices
			- periodically refreshes
3. Content Providers
	- database persistence:
		- Cloud, etc.
		- stored in database, viewed by others
4. Intents
	- we will work on this Thursday*
	- within an activity, starting a new activity on another app
		- e.g. need to send a message from inside app
		- needs to start the connectivity of the messenger
		- do this using an Intent Object
5. Broadcast Receivers
6. Widgets
7. Notifications 

Last Time:
we looked at the Android Manifest (XML file)
	- each activity: contains an XML node

Changing an App:
1. Declarative:
	- change using the XML
2. Procedural:
	- change usign Java
3. Mixed:
	- both

* Use declarative XML as much as possible
	- easier to understand, less likely to change

Basic Elements
1. View
2. ViewGroup
3. Layout
* see PP for diagram
	- Frame
	- Linear
	- Relative
	- Table
	- Absolute (unpopular)

Vertical
	- res/layout-land/main.xml
	- can contain TableLayout nested in ListLayout
Horizontal
	- res/layout/main.xml
	- can contain ListLayout

Cognitive Friction
	- allow manipulation of objects, rather than checkboxes with sudden adjustments

Simplify:
- Brief (least wording possible)
- Pictures > Words
- Best Guess but allow user to make changes
- Only show me when I need it:
- Learn from preferences
	- statistically, what is the path that the user takes more often?
	- make that the first option for the user
	- next week (how to use User Preferences to store Data)

"The inmates are running the asylum"
- book to read (presumably about design and programming)

Starting an Activity:
	- not main() method
	- starts in an Activity instance
		- callback methods to start and stop

Android Application Life Cycle
1. onCreate() - Activity is Created 
2. onStart() - Activity is Started
3. onResume() - Load shared preferences, and other data
		- why not load data on the start or create?:
			- if the app gets paused,
			- the activity should be silently killed
				(if the activity in the foreground needs more resources)
onPause()
onStop()
onDestroy()
