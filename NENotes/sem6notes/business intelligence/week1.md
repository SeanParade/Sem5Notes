# Business Intelligence
- mining data to get business intelligence from it
- need to be able to understand mathematical expression

## Data Warehousing
- e.g. Airmiles
	- collect data (what you are buying) and sell it

## Recommended books
- Textbook: Delivering Business Intelligence With Microsoft...
- Knight's Microsoft Business Intelligence 24-Hour Trainer

## Testing
- 4 Lab based assignments 5% each 25% total
- Mini project 20%
	- small group project
- Midterm 20%
- Final 35%

### What we'll cover
1. Tool Agnostic
2. Data sets
3. Visualization
	- D3: javascript library for visualization of data
4. Implementation of Algorithms
	- Linear Regression
	- *not* actually linear
4.5. Data Modelling
	- conceptual, logical, physical (e.g. actual datatypes for database - dependent on type of db)
5. Data Modelling for Business Intelligence
	- star schema, snowflake schema
	- conceptual, then logical, physical
		- business terms, technical terms
	- banks will love you

### No idea but look this up, probably not the mythology
- Hyperion?

### Model
- Database:
	- ERD
	- stucture for data
- Data Science:
	- extract data, make model, apply model to new data
- Statician:
	- ^^
- from the data vs for the data

### Logical vs Conceptual models
- logical has the details of the tables
- conceptual has table names, etc.

#### Architect Example
- logical rules depend on what type of building is being made
- conceptual model would be the person who wants a home drawing it on a napkin
- when architectural terms are assigned - constraints etc, it becomes a logical model

#### In Databases
- normalization (creation of more tables)
- how to resolve relationships
- constraints
- using the design rules to create the database

### Data Cleansing
- remove lines
- open in wordpad
- press Paragraph symbol and remove
- other tricks
- lots of repos for cleansing data
