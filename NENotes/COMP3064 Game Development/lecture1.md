# Game Development
## Lecture 1

### Info
  - ppawluk@georgebrown.ca
  - use Unity
    - gameplay logic will be in C#
  - build 3 games
  - Textbook: Unity 4 Fundamentals - Alan Thorn
    - can use any book about Unity

### What is Unity?
  - suite of technologies & tools
  - distribute to multiple platforms
  - can create:
    - games
    - simulations

### What is a game?
  - interactive
  - entertainment
  - set of rules and objectives
  - "objective engine"
  - increasing challenge

#### Dimensions of games
  - soft real-time
  - interactive
  - agent-based
  - simulations

#### Simulations
  - use models:
    - for looks and for behaviour
    - approximations
    - more realistic = more computation

#### Agent-Based
  - entities that can be interacted with
  - simulation : number of distinct agents interact

#### Interactive Temporal simulation
  - world stat is dynamic
  - must respond to player's input

#### Deadlines
  - non-catastrophic deadlines can be missed

#### Successful game
  1. Engaging
  - Entertaining
  - Enjoyable
  - Elastic
  - Expandable
  - Social

### Designing a Game
#### Audience
  - who will be playing the game?
  - small things:
    - adjustable controls
    - change/ modify the character?
  - look at groups in powerpoints:
    1. Killers
    - Achievers
    - Socializers
    - Explorers

#### Game Engines
  - e.g. first: Doom
  - separation between components and assets
    - players could create levels
  - data-driven architecture
    - game engine is fed with data = interactive level

##### Benefits:
  - fast prototyping (build on existing game engines)
  - user gen content
  - limited programming knowledge can use built in scripting to customize behaviour
  - portability

#### The Game Loop
  - see powerpoint diagram
  - >>Gather Player Input>>Update World State>>Apply Game Logic>>Draw Frame>>
    - (as a circle)

### Unity Engine technologies
  - 3D Graphics Engine
  - Physics Engine
  - Scripting
  - Audio, Animation, Lighting, Particles (assets)

#### Scripting
  - C#
  - Unity API

#### Editor
  - we are not covering photoshop Etc we will be using Unity Editor
  - focus is not on building assets but on building the actual game

#### Final Note:
  - check lab for version of Unity to download
  - before lab: set up Unity account to download store products (assets)
    - 1. Side Scroller
    - 2. Platformer
    - 3. using models?
